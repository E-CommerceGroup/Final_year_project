# Rare Disease Detection Using Diffusion-Based Synthetic Data Generation and Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a modular deep learning framework for rare disease analysis using medical images. The core challenge addressed is the scarcity of labeled medical data for rare diseases, which limits the performance of traditional supervised learning models. To overcome this limitation, the project leverages diffusion-based synthetic image generation using Stable Diffusion fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), followed by disease classification and user-level disease prediction.

The system is designed as a three-module pipeline:
1. Synthetic data generation using diffusion models
2. Disease classification using transfer learning
3. User-level disease presence prediction and risk assessment

The proposed framework is intended as a **decision-support system** and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Rare diseases suffer from a severe lack of annotated medical images due to low prevalence, high acquisition costs, and strict privacy regulations. Existing generative approaches such as GANs often fail to produce stable, diverse, and anatomically consistent images. This project addresses these issues by using diffusion models with parameter-efficient fine-tuning to generate high-quality synthetic data and improve downstream disease prediction performance.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Module 1: Synthetic Dataset Generation
- Fine-tunes Stable Diffusion using LoRA on limited real medical images
- Learns disease-specific visual characteristics
- Generates diverse synthetic medical images
- Saves generated images directly into the unified `data/` directory

### Module 2: Disease Classification
- Uses a **common training pipeline** for all diseases
- Trains classifiers on:
  - Real images only
  - Synthetic images only
  - Real + Synthetic images
- Employs transfer learning for improved accuracy and generalization
- Outputs trained disease-specific models

### Module 3: Disease Prediction & Risk Assessment
- Accepts a single medical image as input
- Uses trained models from Module 2 for inference
- Predicts whether a disease is present or not
- Optionally incorporates symptom information to estimate risk levels
- Acts as a decision-support tool
